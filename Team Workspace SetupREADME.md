**Team Workspace Setup**
  A shared team workspace was created to enable collaborative system design using the selected CASE tool.
  
  **The workspace setup includes:**
  A single centralized CASE project file for all UML diagrams
  Shared access provided to all team members
  Version control rules defined to avoid conflicts while editing diagrams
  Naming conventions followed for diagrams and elements (actors, classes, methods)

**Team members were assigned responsibilities for specific diagram types:**
  **Project Manager**: Review and approval of diagrams
  **Lead Developer:** Class and sequence diagrams
  **Documentation Lead**: Use case and activity diagrams
  **QA Lead:** Validation of design consistency and correctness

This collaborative workspace ensured:
Smooth coordination among team members
Consistent design documentation
Alignment of UML diagrams with the implemented E-Book Management System
