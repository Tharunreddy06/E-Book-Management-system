**CASE Tool Setup**

  For the design phase of the E-Book Management System, a Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool was selected and configured to support system modeling and documentation.
  
  Selected CASE Tool: StarUML / Visual Paradigm
  
  The CASE tool was installed on the development systems of all team members and configured with the following settings:
  
  UML 2.x diagram support enabled
  
  Project template configured for Software Engineering documentation
  
  Diagram types enabled:
  
  Use Case Diagram
  
  Class Diagram
  
  Sequence Diagram
  
  Activity Diagram
  
  Component Diagram
  
  Deployment Diagram
  
  The CASE tool was used to visually represent the structure, behavior, and architecture of the E-Book Management System.
  This setup ensured consistency between requirements, design artifacts, and system implementation
