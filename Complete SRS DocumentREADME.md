**Complete SRS Document**

    The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for the E-Book Management System has been completed by consolidating all requirement-related activities performed in previous tasks.
    The SRS document includes the following major sections:
    Introduction (Purpose, Scope, Definitions, Acronyms)
    Overall Description (Product Perspective, Product Functions, User Characteristics, Constraints)
    Functional Requirements (FR-01 to FR-10)
    Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Reliability, Usability)
    Scope Definition (In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Features)
    Stakeholder Analysis and Stakeholder Register
    Use Case Descriptions and Diagrams
    Glossary of Terms

The document clearly defines what the system should do, how users interact with the system, and the constraints under which the system operates.
It serves as a formal reference for development, testing, and future enhancements.
The completed SRS document is structured to span 8–12 pages as per SEAD guidelines and accurately reflects the implemented features of the E-Book Management System
